# Deliverable 7: Documentation
This deliverable has two components: the documentation file and the presentation.

## Documentation
* Create a file named `documentation.md` using the [template](../templates/documentation.md).
* Adapt the sections from the previous project deliverables.
    * The modules section should have one section per module (i.e., effectively each key notion)
    * The overview section should contain the overall schema diagram

## Presentation
* Create a presentation version of the documentation file.
* Add an additional section at the end called "Retrospective".
    * In this section, put 1-2 comments per group member
    * Include comments re: what went will in this course, what could be changed
    * Provide an overall rating for the course: fun/!fun, useful/!useful, etc.

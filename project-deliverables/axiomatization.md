# Conduct Systematic Axiomatization
This deliverable is comprised of two artifacts: `axioms.md` and `axioms.owl`.

* Create an `axioms.md` file using the `axioms.md` [template](../templates/axioms.md).
* Using the schema diagrams produced in the previous deliverable, iterate through each node-edge-node construction.
    * Identify from the list of axiom patterns provided during lecture which axioms apply for that construction. **Note:** Patterns may already have these axioms provided.
    * Use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to generate these axioms. **Note:** Remember to choose an appropriate base URI for your ontology. **Note:** Save the ontology in Turtle syntax.
    * Provide a natural language description and reasoning for why that axiom applies in this case.
* Consider if there are any rules or axioms which must be addressed outside of the scope of the axioms patterns. These generally have a complex structure using `if...then` formulation or have `and`s or `or`s in them.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes to the artifact via explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.

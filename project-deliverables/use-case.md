# Build the Use-case
1. Create a file called `use-case.md` from the [template](../templates/use-case.md).
2. Create a subsection `## Narrative` which should contain a top-level description of your use-case. As a guideline, this section should be about 500 words. This should, at a minimum, answer the questions:
    * Who are you supporting?
    * What are their goals?
    * Why is making a Knowledge Graph interesting -- or important -- for the use-case? 
    * Why a knowledge graph and not a relational (tabular) database?
3. Create a subsection called `## Competency Questions`. Thoroughly describe your intended interactions and what data you will retrieve to support said interactions. Provide no fewer than 10 competency questions.
4. Create a subsection called `## Potential Datasets`. Provide links and access dates for no less than five potential datasets.
5. If you included references, provide them in a `## References` section.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes to this document in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.

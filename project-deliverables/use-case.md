# Build the Use-case
1. Create a file called `use-case.md` from the [template](../templates/use-case.md).
2. Fill the `Narrative` section with a top-level description of your use-case, including references. As a guideline, this section should be about 500 words. This should, at a minimum, answer the questions:
    * Who are you supporting?
    * What are their goals?
    * Why is making a Knowledge Graph interesting -- or important -- for the use-case? 
    * Why a knowledge graph and not a relational (tabular) database?
3. Fill the `Competency Questions` section with no fewer than 10 competency questions. Thoroughly describe your intended interactions and what data will be retrieved to support said interactions.
4. Fill the `Potential Datasets` section with links and access dates for no less than five potential datasets.
5. Fill the `Existing Resources` section with any resources (e.g., ontologies, knowledge graphs, or standards) which can be used in the project.
6. Provide all references in the `References` section. References should be numbered starting at 1, listed in order of appearance, and otherwise following the IEEE reference style. Ensure that the DOI is included for every reference, where available.

**Note:** Ensure that each member contributes to this document in explicit commits. Do not squash commits; the `git` history will serve as a record of participation and contribution.
